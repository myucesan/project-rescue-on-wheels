	\section{Introduction}
	This document is an exploration of the process of creating the Metabot. In this document you'll gain insight into how the cooperation within the team started and evolved, agreements we made regards our cooperation, priorities set before and during the development and finally any problems encountered during the project.
	\newpage
	\section{SWOT Analysis}
	To start off our project in the best possible way, we needed to understand our group dynamic. How our group will behave and perform. To gain a better understanding of this dynamic our coach tasked us with the development of a 'Strenghts, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis'.\\ This chapter contains said analysis. First, SWOT analyses of each individual member which are then combined to create a group analysis. This approach was chosen because the group itself may create different characteristics but it still consists of individual members. If we understand the members as individuals, we may get a better understanding of the group.
