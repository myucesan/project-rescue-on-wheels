	\section{Introduction}
	This document contains all the information regarding "Metabot" our rescue on wheels project. This document will describe the design phase, working phase and post-launch phase consisting of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An analysis of the requirements for the project from the perspective of an user.
		\item A design model which explains in great detail how the system is built.
		\item Documentation containing important code segments with comments and explanations as well guidance for installation, operation and maintenance.
	\end{itemize} 
	Metabot is a Raspberry Pi powered mobile robot designed to assist in rescue operations. The robot will be able to navigate difficult to traverse environments and explore areas as a sort of reconnaissance unit.\\
	Metabot is equipped with a camera which will broadcast to a mobile device on which the user can control the robot as well as see said camera feed. The camera has a facial recognition functionality to assist in spotting survivors.\\
	Whilst navigating the operating environment Metabot will map the area and ping locations on the map when survivors are found.\\ 
	\\Metabot will be able to explore and create a map of the area with the locations of survivors. This way, having seen the environment and knowing the locations of the survivors,  the rescue team will be able to conduct a swift and efficient rescue operation.\\
	\\The following chapters will describe the robot in more details as well as it's design. We will begin with the analysis of the requirements for the Metabot. 
	\newpage
	\section{Analysis}
	The analysis consists of the following parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Epic
		\item User stories
		\item Detailed requirements
		\item Use-case diagram
		\item Domain model\\
	\end{itemize}	
	The formulation of the requirements was performed based on user stories. These user stories were created based on an epic. An agile epic is a body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (called ''stories,'' or ''user stories'') based on the needs/requests of customers or end users\footnote{https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics}.\\
	\\After having created said requirements we will formulate the Use-case diagram(s) and the Domain model(s). These will visualize the user interaction with our system and our Metabot.

	 \subsection{Epic}
	 A building has collapsed trapping the people inside. Some managed to get out in time but others weren't so lucky. Upon arrival at the scene our actor assesses the situation. The building is unstable and the trapped survivors need to be rescued as quickly as possible.\\
	 \\Normally a rescue crew would be assembled and they would slowly make their way through the rubble to search for people. This is a dangerous and time-consuming task. The crew has no idea whether or not there is a way to get to the survivors. Removing rubble could make the building collapse even further. These people need to be found and removed from the ruins before this happens.\\
	 \\Luckily our actor has just the tool for this job. The Metabot, a small remote controlled robot that can do the scouting for our actor. Our actor takes out his phone and boots up the app. Here, our actor can control the robot.\\
	 \\Our actor sends the robot into the ruins, slowly making it's way deeper and deeper into the building. Whilst moving, the robot sends out signals to its surroundings to map the area and to avoid collision with objects. Meanwhile, our actor can see what the robot is seeing through the live camera feed. Our actor uses this feed to try and find survivors while also looking around for possible routes to take with the rescue crew.\\
	 \\Once our actor has found a survivor, the robot's facial recognition software will help our actor detect the survivor. After this detection, the robot will ping the location of the survivor on the map so that our actor knows where in relation to the rest of the building the survivors are. After pinging the location, the robot will give a visual light signal to the survivors to let them know they have been found and will soon be rescued.\\
	 \\After mapping the area and locating the survivors our actor can create a rescue plan and execute it. Having performed reconnaissance safely and quickly with the Metabot, our rescue crew can now swiftly save the survivors.

	 \subsection{User stories}
	 From this epic story we could formulate user stories, this resulted in the following table:
